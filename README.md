# Game of Life
This is a simulation of Conway's Game of Life, utilising a GUI built in PyGame.

## Required libraries
* PyGame
* NumPy
* SciPy

## Setup
* Install required libraries locally using pip.
* Note: issues have been discovered when trying to run pygame projects on Mac OS Catalina. Setting up a virtual environment using Python 3.7.5 and PyGame 1.9.8 appears to solve the problem.

## Features
* Manual input of live cells using mouse clicks.
* Random mode for quickly setting up a system of cells without manual input.

## Project Status
* Project is _complete_.
